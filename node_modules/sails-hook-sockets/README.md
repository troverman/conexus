`sockets` hook for Sails v0.11

## Status

> ##### Stability: [3](http://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index) - Stable


## Purpose

This hook's responsibilities are:

#### When initialized...
+ fire up socket.io server
+ listen for connect / disconnect events
  + listen for get/post/put/delete/patch events
    + create bare-bones request and response contexts, then pass them to the core interpreter in Sails to be routed on the fly.

#### Bind "shadow" routes...

###### `before`
N/A

###### `after`

+ `GET __getcookie`


#### Expose on the `sails` app object:

+ `sails.sockets.*` (see reference documentationÂ for sails.sockets on sailsjs.org for full list of exposed methods)

## FAQ

#### What is this?

This repo contains a hook, one of the building blocks Sails is made out of.

#### What version of Sails is this for?

The versioning of a hook closely mirrors that of the Sails version it depends on.  While the "patch" version (i.e. the "Z" in "X.Y.Z") will normally differ from that of Sails core, the "minor" version number (i.e. the "Y" in "X.Y.Z") of this hook is also the minor version of Sails for which it is designed.  For instance, if a hook is version `0.11.9`, it is designed for Sails `^0.11.0` (that means it'll work from 0.11.0 all the way up until 0.12.0).

#### Does this hook use Socket.io v1.0?

Yes.

#### Are there changes?

Yes, see the [v0.11 migration guide](http://sailsjs.org/#!/documentation/concepts/Upgrading). You probably won't need to change anything unless you were extensively using the old Socket.io v0.9 configuration.


## Running the tests

First, clone this repo, cd into it, and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-hook-sockets.git
cd sails-hook-sockets
npm install
```

#### Run them all

To run all the tests, start a local redis server on port 6380 and then run the tests using mocha:

```sh
redis-server --port 6380
npm test
```


#### Run only certain tests

Alternatively, you can run a particular set of tests with:

```sh
node ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha -g 'without session'
```

> (this may be useful if you don't want to wait for all the tests to run, or e.g. if you aren't able to install a redis server locally.  However please make sure all the tests pass before submitting a PR.)
