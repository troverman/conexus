License
-------
This library is available under the MIT license. However it and is a wrapper for Highcharts. Highcharts itself has an own license. So make sure to follow their license as well (https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/blob/master/license.txt)

Note: You need to include the Highcharts library your self. It is not included in this repository.

Current Version
---------------
**Needs Highcharts/Highstock >= 5.0.0**

**Only supports AngularJS >= 1.5.8**

**Configuration Format is not compatible with highcharts-ng 0.x.0**


**Setup:**

Install with npm:

```bash
npm install highcharts-ng
```

or with bower:

```bash
bower install highcharts-ng --save
```

Add highcharts as project dependency with npm
```bash
npm install highcharts
```

or with bower:

```bash
bower install highcharts --save
```

Add references to Highcharts/Highstocks:

```html
<script src="http://code.highcharts.com/stock/highstock.src.js"></script>
```

or

```html
<script src="http://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.src.js"></script>
```

Add Highcharts to your Angular app config:

```javascript
var myapp = angular.module('myapp', ["highcharts-ng"]);
```

(optional) if you have some problems with resizing the chart to screen size, include the highcharts-ng css file

```html
<link href="dist/highcharts-ng.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Make a chart!

```html
<highchart id="chart1" config="chartConfig"></highchart>
```

The `chartConfig` object should be the same as a normal highcharts configuration. Any options that work in highcharts should work here also. To use highstock charts, you just need to add `chartType: 'stock'` to your `chartConfig`.

It is **Highly Recommended** to give all Series and Axes a distinct ID.

All properties on the chart configuration are optional. If you don't need a feature best to leave it out completely - Highcharts will usually default to something sensible. Each property is watched for changes by angularjs.

After construction the Highcharts Chart object can be accessed with ```chartConfig.getChartObj()```. This is a simple way to access all the Highcharts API that is not currently managed by this directive. See the JSFiddle basic example to see how this is used to call the print function of Highcharts.

Sometimes it could make sense to create an entire new Highcharts Chart instead of updating the previous one. For this to happen, you need to pass an entire new chart configuration object to the component instead of updating the previous configuration object. (See example section above)

If you know the chart data is not going to change, you can disabled the changeDetection to improve performance. This can be done with the attribute ```disable-change-detection="true"```. However this really only affects charts with huge data sets. (See example section above)

Features:
---------

- Adding and removing series
- Setting/Updating Chart options
- Updating the chart title
- Resizes with screen size changes.
- Providing a custom changeDetection function or expression - for speed a custom changeDetection function can be provided to save dirty checking the full chart config.

Features Not Supported that were previously supported:
------------------------------------------------------
- 2 way binding to chart xAxis. (use chartConfig.getChartObj() to get axis values)
- Control of Loading status though the config (use chartConfig.getChartObj() to get axis values)
Both of these should be possible to add with the right PR
- Use of add and remove points on dynamically updated series


Caveats:
--------

- Due to many equality checks the directive maybe slow with large datasets - try using changeDetection instead
- Whole Chart/Series is often redrawn where a simple update of data would suffice
- If you don't assign ids to your series - incremental ids will be added. This may mean extra redraws.
- Needs more tests!

FAQ:
--------


- Whats different to previous 0.0.X versions?

This version is much much simpler and should be more stable. Some features however are still to be implemented
e.g. 2-way binding to axes and loading functionality

- How do I get access to the chart object?

You can use `config.getChartObj`. 95% of the time you should not need this and should instead change the chartConfig instead.

Be careful - if you manually change something with the chart object that is also in the chartConfig the chart and the config may end up out of sync.  

- Why don't you just use the standard Highcharts format?

Since 1.0.0, vanilla Highcharts objects are supported!
