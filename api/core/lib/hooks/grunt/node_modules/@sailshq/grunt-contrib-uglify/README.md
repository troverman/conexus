# This is a fork of [grunt-contrib-uglify](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=grunt-contrib-uglify).

This fork exists in order to have a published version of the [harmony branch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify/tree/harmony) of grunt-contrib-uglify, which allows minification of ES6-compatible JavaScript.

For grunt-contrib-uglify docs, see the [main README](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify/tree/harmony).
