#### What happened to the old core generators?

Originally, Sails' core generators were spread across multiple repos and NPM packages.  For easier maintainence, they were pulled inline in `sails-generate` as part of Sails v1.  But they can still be overridden or disabled in [the same way as before](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/generators/custom-generators).
