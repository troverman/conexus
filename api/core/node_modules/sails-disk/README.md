# sails-disk <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_database"><img src="http://sailsjs.com/images/icon_hardisk.png" title="sails-disk"/></a>

A local disk adapter for the Sails framework and Waterline ORM.  Functions as a persistent object store which works great as a bundled, starter database (with the strict caveat that it is for non-production use only).  It is bundled with the `sails-hook-orm` hook that is included by default in new Sails projects.

> Under the hood, this uses [nedb](http://npmjs.com/package/nedb).
