# Simulation

This simulation code is designed to allow us to test DHT behaviors without hitting the network.

## Run
The simulation can be run from project root via the npm `sim` script:

```bash
npm run sim
```

There is a `VERBOSE` property that can be set to `true`for additional logging. This should probably become a flag if the sim is expanded.
