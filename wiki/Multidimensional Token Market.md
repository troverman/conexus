## Postion Types

### Trade Postion
### On Mint Postion

## Order Books

## Traversals

## Crystalline structure begets self-similar assets
### Pluralistic Assets & Positions
    → create powerful linkages
    [a,b]
    	→ relationships

# Building Blocks
## A Tensor Network

#### A, B, C, D,
    → relationships

#### Market Circuits
    eight dimensional depth

	a → eight d tensor walk

	a → b → c → d → e → f → h

	a → c → a → b → d → e → f

	a → c …

	...

##### Higher Dimensional Combinatorials require at least n-dim base state
