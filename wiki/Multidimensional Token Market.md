## Crystalline structure begets self-similar assets
### pluralistic assets
    →create powerful linkages

# Building Blocks
## A Tensor network

### A, b, c, d,
    → relationships

### pluralistic assets
[a,b]
    → relationships

#### market circuits
    eight dimensional depth

a → eight d tensor walk

a ->b ->c->d->e->f->h

a->c->a->b->d->e->f

a->c…

##### higher dimensional combinatorials require at least n-dim base state

the market space is
	→ ratio of asset and amount of asset
    (angle and length) 

(any other rules) 

we create our own algebra here.
