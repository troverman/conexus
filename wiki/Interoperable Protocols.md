# Interoperable Protocol Architecture
##Information mapping to a balance
##Token are meta data ‘imbued’ as economic tradable assets

```
contract Protocol {
 
}
```

Protocols define logic and create 'logic manifolds' nested within a token strucutre. 

# Layered Adaptability

# Core protocols

## Data Protocol	

## Project Protocol
The set of logic is driven by the organization
	the manifold defined 'organization+' 
	'organization+'

## Member Protocol
	Personal manifolds Address+{}
	'Address+'

## Content Protocol
	CONTENT
	{id}

## ORDER Protocol
	ORDER
	{id}
	{}

## Reaction Protocol
	REACTION
	{id}
	REACTION+[TYPE]
	REACTION+[TYPE]+{modelAddress}
	Linkage with Model (work out rotational equalities via language interperlation & algebra(s) | a+b+c is congruent to c+b+a is congruent to b+c+a)

## Relationship Protocol
	{+[tag]+}
	{+Related Model+}

## Task Protocol
Nested in relationship between Project & Time
	{id}

## Time Protocol
	TIME
	{id}
	{}

## Transaction Protocol

	Transaction action token domain | all multiplicative combinations of data as tokens

	Transaction – creator and recipient get 1 Transaction token
	Transaction+creator - creator gets 1 Transaction+creator token
	Transaction+recipient - recipient gets 1 Transaction+recipient token
	 
	//Transaction+descriptionString - recipient gets 1 Transaction+descriptionString token
	 
	Transaction+asset - creator and recipient get 1 Transaction+asset token
	Transaction+asset+creator - creator gets 1 Transaction+asset+creator token
	Transaction+asset+recipient - recipient gets 1 Transaction+asset+recipient token
	 
	Transaction+tag - creator and recipient get 1 Transaction+tag token
	Transaction+tag+creator - creator gets 1 Transaction+tag+creator token
	Transaction+tag+recipient - recipient gets 1 Transaction+tag+recipient token
	 
	Transaction+id – creator and recipient get 1 Transaction+id token
	Transaction+id+creator - creator gets 1 Transaction+id+creator token
	Transaction+id+recipient - recipient gets 1 Transaction+id+recipient token
	 
	Transaction+asset+tag – creator and recipient get 1 Transaction+asset+tag token
	Transaction+asset+tag+creator - creator gets 1 Transaction+asset+tag+creator token
	Transaction+asset+tag+recipient - recipient gets 1 Transaction+asset+tag+ recipient token
	 
	Transaction+asset+id+tag – creator and recipient get 1 Transaction+asset+id+tag token
	Transaction+asset+id+tag+creator - creator gets 1 Transaction+asset+id+tag+creator token
	Transaction+asset+id+tag+recipient - creator gets 1 Transaction+asset+id+tag+recipient token

	Transaction+asset+tag ≅ Transaction+tag+asset ≅ tag+Transaction+asset ≅ tag+asset+Transaction ≅ ....

	Transaction+asset

	USD.SEND VS TRANSACTION+USD+SEND

	VERBS ; CREATOR VS SEND

	TRANSACTION
	{id}
	{}




## View Protocol
	'Address+VIEW+'

## Validation Protocol
	'+VALIDATION'

# Organizational Pattern
## Project -> Task -> Time

# '3rd Layer of Compilation'
	Nested Chain Interaction
	Encoding of hashed information into token balance layer begetes emergent value data congruence






## EXAMPLE

TENANT CLOCKIN TOKEN | BUSHWICK GENERATOR
bgTime | minted by member on action / KEYIN ~(TIME+ADDRESS)
usageToken (stu+{context}) | minted by bg ~(BrandedUsageTokenString)
 
Liquidity & Sponsorship
1. Sponsor creates an onMint bgTime liquidity bridge
      onMint bgTime, receive sponsorship token + bgTime token on action

2. Sponsor creates a traditional bgTime liquidity bridge
      Trade bgTime for CRE8; a token; eth; usd | classic
 
Reputation comparisons between usageToken and bgTime
Total usageToken created vs bgTime earned
  
Time spent (bgTime) vs Time Credit (usageToken)
 
Dimensional onMint usageToken position from bg
	ie perform task (sweep) and receive timeCredit;
    account for timeCredit and timeSpent
 
PURCHASE TIME CREDIT VIA TOKENS
bg creates trade positionsl sell 1 usageToken @ $0.001388 ($40/8 hours)
 
Smart keycard start the clock and checks time space reputation
	Specifically (timeCredit (usageToken)) – (timeSpent(bgTime)) > 0
    If low  tell em purchase or do chores.
 
I need a reputation specific amount of usageToken to key in.

Life Time reputations with usage + helper task dimensions 
 
//(edge case where user sells bgTime and usageToken on open market
negative assets as a concept.. )
//inverse market equiv – selling price (pay someone to take bgTime)
