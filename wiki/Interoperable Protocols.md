Protocols define logic and create 'logic manifolds' nested within a token strucutre. 

# Layered Adaptability

# Core protocols

## Project Protocol
the set of logic is driven by the orginization
the manifold defined 'orginization+' 
	'orginization+'

## Member Protocol
## 'Address+'

## Content Protocol
	CONTENT
	{id} | NFT

## Reaction Protocol
	REACTION
	{id} | NFT
	REACTION+[TYPE]
	REACTION+[TYPE]+{modelAddress}

## Relationship Protocol
	{+[tag]+}
	{+Related Model+}

## Task Protocol
Nested in relationship between Project & Time
	{id} | NFT


## Time Protocol
	TIME
	{id} | NFT
	{}

## View Protocol
	'Address+VIEW+'

## Validation Protocol
Tertiarty language space
	'+VALIDATION'

# Organizational Pattern
## Project -> Task -> Time
