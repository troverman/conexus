# Interoperable Protocol Architecture

```
contract Protocol {
 
}
```

Protocols define logic and create 'logic manifolds' nested within a token strucutre. 

# Layered Adaptability

# Core protocols

## Data Protocol	

## Project Protocol
The set of logic is driven by the organization
	the manifold defined 'organization+' 
	'organization+'

## Member Protocol
	'Address+'

## Content Protocol
	CONTENT
	{id}

## ORDER Protocol
	ORDER
	{id}
	{}

## Reaction Protocol
	REACTION
	{id}
	REACTION+[TYPE]
	REACTION+[TYPE]+{modelAddress}
	Linkage with Model (work out rotational equalities via language interperlation & algebra(s) | a+b+c is congruent to c+b+a is congruent to b+c+a)

## Relationship Protocol
	{+[tag]+}
	{+Related Model+}

## Task Protocol
Nested in relationship between Project & Time
	{id}


## Time Protocol
	TIME
	{id}
	{}

## Transaction Protocol
	TRANSACTION
	{id}
	{}

## View Protocol
	'Address+VIEW+'

## Validation Protocol
	Tertiary language space
	'+VALIDATION'

# Organizational Pattern
## Project -> Task -> Time

# '3rd Layer of Compilation'
	Nested Chain Interaction
	Encoding of hashed information into token balance layer begetes emergent value data congruence
